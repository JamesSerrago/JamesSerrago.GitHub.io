    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" class="border" alt="James Serrago" stylw="display:block">

       <p>Hello my name is James Serrago and  I was born and raised in Queens, New York.
    Growing up in the city I have come to the realization that the world is heavily dictated
    by technology and becoming proficient in the various different programs that buisness have
    come to adopt was going to become more and more necessary in order to survive in the modern world.<br></p1>
     <p1><br>Going foward I would like the foundation of web design to drive my career foward. I would like to
    expand my knowledge of every aspect of it, in hopes of eventually getting into search engine optimization.
    here are many components that go into building websites which is why I am currently studying New Media Technology
    at LaGuardia Community College. I have started to learn how to use HTML and CSS for the back end of website
    development while I also have started to learn the front end of it through programs such as Adobe XD.<br></p1>
     <p1><br>S.E.O. or search engine optimization is what has interested me the most out of all the various
    subjects in the web design field. As time has gone on I have seen search engines like Google evolve and change
    which in turn has caused different websites to also evolve in order to keep up with it. Since this process will
    likely continue for the foreseeable future, I think that becoming well versed in this subject would lead me to a
    ever changing and interactive work environment that will keep me engaged and excited for my career.<br></p1>
