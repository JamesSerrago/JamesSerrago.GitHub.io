    <h1>Projects</h1><br>
    <h2>Pac-Man Video</h2>
        <p>One project I would like to show is one that I did in my Intro to New Media class in which we were allowed
        to create anything as long as we made use of 3 applications we went over in class. I ended up using Adobe
        Illustrator, Premiere and Photoshop in order to make my own version of Pac-Man.

<h2>Web Development Site</h2>
<a name="webdevsite"></a>

         <p>This next project was a site I built going over multiple aspects of being a web developer.
           I did some research on all of the different aspects that go into building websites and put them together in HTML and CSS.

<h2>Light Up Gif</h2>

      <p> In this gif I created a 3d model in Blender which I then animated together in order
        for a ball to roll across and make the floor look like it was lighting up.</p></br>

  <h2>Color Change Gif</h2>
      <p> In this gif I made a 3d model in Blender which I then animated to schange it's colors
        and spin while the backround also shifted colors.</p></br>

    </p>

  <h2>Rube Goldberg Video</h2>
   <p> In this video I used Blender to 3d model a rube goldberg machine. I then animated it so the ball goes from the top
     of the machine to the bottom into the garbage can. I wanted it to have an elaborate pinball
   machine effect where the ball is constantly being moved through the use of elevators.</p></br>

   </p>

   <h2>T.V. World Video</h2>
   <p> In this video I used Blender to create a 3d model and and was trying to create
     a world within a television. I wanted the viewer to be as confused as to what is
     going on around them as the character is in order to create a more mysterious tone.
     I animated all of the camera movement and used pre made animation cycles for the
     characters movement.</p></br>

   <h2>U.F.O Gif</h2>

     <p> In this gif I used Blender to 3d model a ufo and a landscape. I then animated a ball
       to roll out and be picked up by the ufo. I wanted to animate the ufo in a way that made it look like
       it was moving so I had it rotate while it was raing and lowering onto the field.</p></br>

  <h2>Dream Room</h2>
  <p> In these image's I used Blender to 3d model a series of rooms that go from normal
    to weird to even weirder. I wanted to play with the idea of waking up in a dream
    where yor somewhere familar but as it goes on it gets crazier and crazier.</p></br>
