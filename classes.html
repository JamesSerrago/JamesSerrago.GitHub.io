    <h1>Educational Objectives</h1>
    <p>My major at LaGuardia community college is Mew Media Technology
       and that is the focus on learning the variety of multimedia technologies
       that we use in order to create the various types of digital content that
       is in such a high demand in todays world.

    One of the clases that has been important to me during my time at Laguardia
       was my english 101 class. This was the very first class I started taking as part of my college
       degree and it was important to me because it taught me the fundamentals of not only college itself but
       also how to write a well developed essay.
    Another class that was important to me was Intro to New Media as it is what solidified my interest in
        the mew media field. The class showed the comprhensive list of things that the field covers and showed how
        relevant it has been in modern day society and how important it will continue to be into the future.</p>
