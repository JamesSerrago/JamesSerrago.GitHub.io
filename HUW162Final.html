    <p> This is t.v. world, a short animation I made using blender and premiere. My idea was to try and create a world set inside of a televison which is why alot of the colors are vibrant. I kept the main characters limbs darker to help him contrast with his surroundings better.
    I wanted to make it feel like the television controlled and influenced the environment has different t.v.'s in it. However I also wanted to add something that let you know it was still a 
    living place so I decided to use this tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/wB0VgyN8tOw"></a> to help make the trees you see in the backround. I tried to go for a strange and mysterious tone 
    like an episode of the twilight zone which is why I used eerie ambient music to help set the tone.</p>
