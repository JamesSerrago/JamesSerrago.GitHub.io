    <p>My cause was to stop the abuse of animals. I picked this because I feel that this is a very common issue unfortuanetly but also one we can still do a lot to help stop. This is important because animals are key to the ecosystem of our planet and without proper care being taken of them, it can be thrown completely out of wack. I ended up using photoshop for the backround image of the dog and the hand cutout. I desaturated the dog and darkened the lighness of it to help further emphasize the text in front of him. I cropped the hand out of another image to make it a more clean picture. Illustrator was used to write the text on the page as well as creating the logo. </p>
