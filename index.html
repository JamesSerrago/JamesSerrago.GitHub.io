		<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
		<p>    My work is a variety of things ranging from understanding the basics of web design 
			to creating something. My sites are made in HTML and CSS while the
			Adobe creative suite is used to make my videos and gifs. Blender is where I 
			do my three dimensional modeling used in some of my work. An idea or theme is where I start when
			using creating and I like to let my work flow from there. My work is inspired from both pop culture and
			people like Stuart Regan who emphazizes simplicty in his web design. I wish to make websites that
			are simplistic and effective in their design while allowing my other works to be more creative and
			in-depth.<br>
		       <br>For my sites I tend to choose more neutral colors in my websites as I think it allows for a more approachable
			UI. When using imagery in my sites I like for it to only be things that are important to the information on the page.
			When I create things like three dimensional models, videos, and gifs I use more abstract colors to 
			help guide the viewer in the direction I want for the piece.
